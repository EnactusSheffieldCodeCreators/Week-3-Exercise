Exercise for Week 3

# Testing
Tests can be run with ```pytest -q solution_test.py```. There are 4 tests in total (since i made 4 functions). Usually you don't have to test every single function, it's better to the ***action*** (have a testing function for ```get_water()``` instead of ```raised_arm()``` and ```grab_water_bottle()```).
